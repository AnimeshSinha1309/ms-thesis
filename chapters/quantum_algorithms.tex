\chapter{Quantum Algorithms and Variational Methods}

Superposition and Entanglement together provide quantum computers with natural parallel processing power. While full access to this parallelism gets bottlenecked at the measurement layer where we can sample only one of the many states in weighted superposition, it is conceivable that for many an algorithm, this parallelism can result in a processing speed-up. A near-term goal with Quantum Computers is to achieve quantum supremacy, which is to solve a problem (possibly one of no practical use) that no classical computer can solve in a feasible amount of time. \cite{quantum-complexity-survey}
