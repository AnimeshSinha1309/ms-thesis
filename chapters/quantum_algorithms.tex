The aim of this chapter is to introduce quantum algorithms which show the practical benefits of using quantum computers. We shall present some intuition behind the most popular algorithms, and then dicuss what their circuit implementations. We try to present some intuition on how 


The first class of algorithms that we will see in this chapter are those which perform useful tasks faster than any known classical algorithm, one which provides an exponential speedup and another which provides a polynomial one, but they are only implementable on error-corrected quantum hardware. The other class of algorithms will by hybrid quantum-classical methods which work well on present day quantum computers and while they don't provide a provable algorithmic speedup over any classical system, in practice they have demonstrated promise as approximation algorithms which can work faster than their classical counterparts.
