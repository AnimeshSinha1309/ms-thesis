Pushing near-term quantum computers to perform useful computations that surpass the capabilities of any classical method is a daunting task, but it seems achievable through iterative progress in domains like quantum algorithm design, error correction methods, noise modeling, hardware design, and many more. In this dissertation, we have explored compilation strategies that make a small step in this direction.
