I want to express my gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Harjinder Singh, for helping me take my first steps in research, help explore the many domains I might be interested in, and eventually helping me start making progress on Quantum Computing. I would also like to thank my senior, Utkarsh Azad, for mentoring me through the entire process, from formulating the problem to benchmarking the results on both the projects and pricing the requisite domain knowledge and intuition required to tackle those problems. Prof. Harjinder Singh and Utkarsh Azad have also helped write and edit this thesis immensely.

Next, I would like to thank the professors in the CCNSB and CQST departments for designing courses that helped me gain interest in the sciences, specifically Quantum. Prof. Subhadip Mitra, Prof. Deva Priyakumar, Prof. Santanav Chakraborty, and many others have taken courses that have helped hone my skills in this domain.

I would also like to thank my friends who helped with techniques learned and ideas developed in the project. Bhuvanesh Sridharan helped out a lot with the Monte Carlo Tree Search formulation of the problem and helped find ways to improve the project iteratively. Kalp Shah and Jai Bardhan contributed valuable thoughts on the scientific and machine learning aspects of the projects involved. Other friends and lab-mates, including Adrian Alva, Shweta Sahoo, Gaurang Tandon, Kanish Anand, and many others, have engaged in discussions on these topics, which have been invaluable to me in validating and extending my ideas.

Finally, I would like to thank my Mom and Dad for their constant support and guidance on all matters, including academic and technical advice.
